# Active Context: MCP-Todoist Integration

## Current Work Focus

We are currently in the initial implementation phase of the MCP-Todoist integration. The focus is on:

1. Setting up the project structure and memory bank
2. Creating the basic MCP server implementation
3. Implementing core Todoist functionality as MCP tools
4. Setting up configuration management for Todoist API tokens
5. Documenting the implementation and usage

## Recent Changes

The project has just been initiated. We have:

1. Created the project directory structure
2. Established the memory bank with core documentation files
3. Set up the git repository

## Next Steps

1. Create the main Python files for the MCP server:
   - `main.py`: Entry point for the MCP server
   - `todoist_tools.py`: Implementation of Todoist tools
   - `todoist_resources.py`: Implementation of Todoist resources
   - `config.py`: Configuration management
   - `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies

2. Implement the first Todoist tools:
   - Create task
   - Get tasks
   - Complete task

3. Implement the first Todoist resources:
   - Task list
   - Project list

4. Set up proper authentication handling with the Todoist API

5. Test the implementation with the MCP development tools

6. Document how to use the integration

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Authentication Approach**: 
   - Decision: Using API token authentication for simplicity
   - Consideration: May need to support OAuth for more secure integration in the future

2. **Error Handling Strategy**:
   - Decision: Implement comprehensive error handling for all API calls
   - Consideration: Need to provide meaningful error messages to the language model

3. **Tool Design**:
   - Decision: Create focused tools that perform specific Todoist operations
   - Consideration: Balance between granularity and usability for language models

4. **Resource Structure**:
   - Decision: Expose Todoist data as structured resources
   - Consideration: Need to handle pagination for large data sets

5. **Configuration Management**:
   - Decision: Support both environment variables and configuration files
   - Consideration: Need to ensure secure handling of API tokens

6. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Decision: Implement unit tests for core functionality
   - Consideration: Need to mock Todoist API calls for testing
