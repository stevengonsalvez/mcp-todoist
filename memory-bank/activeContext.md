# Active Context: MCP-Todoist Integration

## Current Work Focus

We have completed the initial implementation of the MCP-Todoist integration. The focus is now on:

1. Testing the implementation with real-world usage
2. Enhancing authentication beyond just API tokens
3. Improving error handling and rate limit management
4. Adding automated tests for reliability

## Recent Changes

We have implemented the core functionality of the MCP-Todoist integration:

1. Created the main MCP server implementation using FastMCP
2. Implemented Todoist tools for task and project management:
   - Create, read, update, and delete tasks
   - Complete tasks
   - Get projects
3. Implemented Todoist resources for accessing data:
   - Tasks resources with filtering
   - Projects resource
   - Sections resource
   - Labels resource
4. Set up configuration management for Todoist API tokens
5. Implemented error handling for API calls
6. Created documentation and examples

## Next Steps

1. Implement a testing framework:
   - Unit tests for core functionality
   - Integration tests with Todoist API
   - Test mocks for Todoist API

2. Enhance authentication:
   - Add support for OAuth authentication
   - Improve token security

3. Improve error handling:
   - Add retry logic for transient errors
   - Implement rate limit handling with backoff

4. Add additional documentation:
   - Troubleshooting guide
   - API reference
   - Advanced usage examples

5. Explore additional Todoist features:
   - Comments integration
   - Reminders integration
   - Attachment support

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Authentication Approach**:
   - Decision: Using API token authentication for simplicity
   - Consideration: Need to implement OAuth for more secure integration

2. **Error Handling Strategy**:
   - Decision: Basic error handling implemented for all API calls
   - Consideration: Need more sophisticated retry logic and rate limit handling

3. **Tool Design**:
   - Decision: Created focused tools for specific Todoist operations
   - Consideration: May need to add more specialized tools for advanced use cases

4. **Resource Structure**:
   - Decision: Exposed Todoist data as structured resources with markdown formatting
   - Consideration: Need to ensure efficient handling of large data sets

5. **Configuration Management**:
   - Decision: Implemented configuration via environment variables with dotenv support
   - Consideration: May need more secure credential handling

6. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Decision: Need to implement comprehensive testing
   - Consideration: Mock Todoist API calls for reliable testing
