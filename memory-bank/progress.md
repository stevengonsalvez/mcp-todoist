# Progress: MCP-Todoist Integration

## What Works

- Project structure initialized
- Memory bank set up with core documentation
- Git repository established

## What's Left to Build

### Core Implementation
- [ ] Main MCP server implementation
- [ ] Todoist API client integration
- [ ] Configuration management
- [ ] Error handling framework

### MCP Tools
- [ ] Create task tool
- [ ] Get tasks tool
- [ ] Update task tool
- [ ] Complete task tool
- [ ] Delete task tool
- [ ] Get projects tool

### MCP Resources
- [ ] Tasks resource
- [ ] Projects resource
- [ ] Sections resource
- [ ] Labels resource

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Requirements file
- [ ] Development setup documentation
- [ ] Testing framework
- [ ] CI/CD configuration (if needed)

### Documentation
- [ ] Usage documentation
- [ ] Example prompts
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide
- [ ] API reference

## Current Status

Project is in the initial setup phase. No functional code has been implemented yet. The memory bank has been established to document the project's context and goals.

### Next Milestone

Implement a minimal working version with the ability to:
1. Connect to the Todoist API with a token
2. Create a new task
3. List existing tasks

## Known Issues

No functional issues yet as implementation hasn't begun. 

### Potential Challenges

1. **API Rate Limiting**: Need to implement proper handling of Todoist API rate limits
2. **Error Handling**: Need comprehensive error handling for API failures
3. **Authentication Security**: Need secure handling of API tokens
