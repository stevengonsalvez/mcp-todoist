# Product Context: MCP-Todoist Integration

## Why This Project Exists

The MCP-Todoist integration exists to bridge the gap between language models and task management. By exposing Todoist functionality through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), we enable AI assistants to:

1. Help users manage their tasks and to-do lists
2. Create, update, and complete tasks within natural conversations
3. Access and provide information about a user's projects and tasks

## Problems It Solves

1. **Lack of Direct Task Management**: Without this integration, language models have no direct way to interact with a user's Todoist account, limiting their ability to help with task management.

2. **Context Switching**: Users currently need to switch between AI assistants and Todoist to manage their tasks, creating friction in the workflow.

3. **Limited AI Utility**: AI assistants are limited in their practical utility when they cannot directly interact with productivity tools.

4. **Manual Task Creation**: Users must manually transfer suggested tasks from AI conversations to their task management system.

## How It Should Work

1. **Seamless Integration**: The MCP server should serve as a transparent bridge between language models and Todoist.

2. **Natural Interaction**: Users should be able to ask an AI assistant to create, update, or check tasks without needing to know the underlying technical details.

3. **Reliable Execution**: When a language model attempts to create or modify tasks, those operations should reliably execute in Todoist.

4. **Appropriate Permissions**: The integration should require appropriate authentication and respect user permissions within Todoist.

5. **Robust Error Handling**: The server should gracefully handle errors, such as Todoist API rate limits or connectivity issues.

## User Experience Goals

1. **Simplicity**: Users should find it intuitive to have AI assistants manage their Todoist tasks.

2. **Reliability**: Task operations should work consistently and predictably.

3. **Transparency**: Users should understand what actions are being taken on their behalf.

4. **Efficiency**: The integration should save users time compared to manually managing tasks.

5. **Privacy**: User data should be handled securely and according to best practices.

## Target Users

1. **AI Early Adopters**: People who already use AI assistants and want to extend their functionality.

2. **Todoist Power Users**: People who rely heavily on Todoist for task management and want to streamline their workflow.

3. **Productivity Enthusiasts**: People who value optimizing their workflows and processes.

4. **AI Developers**: Developers who want to extend AI capabilities to interact with task management systems.
