# Project Brief: MCP-Todoist Integration

## Overview
This project creates a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that integrates with Todoist, allowing language models to interact with Todoist data and functionality. The integration enables AI assistants to read, create, and manage tasks in Todoist.

## Core Requirements

1. Implement a fully functional MCP server using the Python MCP SDK
2. Connect to Todoist using the official Todoist API Python client
3. Expose Todoist functionality as tools and resources for language models
4. Support basic task management operations (create, read, update, delete, complete)
5. Handle authentication to Todoist via API token
6. Provide clear documentation and examples

## Goals

- **Primary Goal**: Create a reliable MCP server that exposes Todoist functionality to language models
- **User Experience**: Make task management via AI assistants intuitive and efficient
- **Extensibility**: Design the system to be easily extensible for future Todoist features

## Success Criteria

1. Language models can create, read, update, and complete Todoist tasks
2. The server reliably handles API communication with Todoist
3. Documentation clearly explains how to use and extend the integration
4. The codebase follows best practices for Python development

## Constraints

- Must use the official Python MCP SDK
- Must use the official Todoist API Python client
- Authentication will be handled via Todoist API token

## Timeline

The project will be developed incrementally, with core task functionality implemented first, followed by additional features as time permits.
